                        <h4>History</h4>
                        <p>History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation") is the study of the past.Events occurring before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory. "History" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Historians place the past in context using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, ecological markers, and material objects including art and artifacts.</p>

                        <p class="goal-text">A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to achieve.People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.

Goal-setting theory was formulated based on empirical research and has been called one of the most important theories in organizational psychology.[2] Edwin A. Locke and Gary P.</p>

                        <p class="science-text">Science, any system of knowledge that is concerned with the physical world and its phenomena and that entails unbiased observations and systematic experimentation. In general, a science involves a pursuit of knowledge covering general truths or the operations of fundamental laws.The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.[5][6] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical.</p>
